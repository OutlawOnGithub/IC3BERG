# IC3BERG
IC3BERG is cybersecurity oriented discord bot.

## Uses
### Install for developement
As the project was mainly done on ubuntu, we will only cover it for the tutorial.

First of all install python and pip: \
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

Now for a developement use, we will be using venv to isolate it from potential other projects:
```
pip install venv
python -m venv ic3berg
source ic3berg/bin/active
```

After verifying your venv is enable, install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And done ! you can just start the bot using : 
```
python main.py
```
